# Finlatics-Banking-Project
Materials related to the Finlatics capstone project

This was a capstone project I did for the finlatics Data Science Program with Python. The data provided was related to the direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. I carried out data preprocessing, cleaning and preparation. Then carried out some exploratory data analysis and finally investigated the factors that might lead to increased term deposit subscription, if any.

###Data
The data can be found in the "**banking_data.csv**" file. The description of the variables present is in the "**Banking data description.docx**" file. It consists of 45216 rows and 19 columns.
