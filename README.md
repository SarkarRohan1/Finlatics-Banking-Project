# Finlatics-Banking-Project
Materials related to the Finlatics capstone project

This was a capstone project I did for the finlatics Data Science Program with Python. The data provided was related to the direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. I carried out data preprocessing, cleaning and preparation. Then carried out some exploratory data analysis and finally investigated the factors that might lead to increased term deposit subscription, if any.
